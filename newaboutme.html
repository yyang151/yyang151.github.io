                              <p> Through filing tax extensions, calculating client's tax liability with financial models, and working on multiple client projects at the same time, I not only gained a deeper understanding of tax, but most importantly, strengthened my attention to detail, pushed my boundaries of learning, and enhanced my workflow management.</p>

                              <p>I oversaw two projects as director: 1) improve our annual philanthropy event 2) bolster senior member involvement. I'm proud to say that as a direct result of those two projects, PCT created a new broom philanthropy event this fall to replace our annual Trivial Night. Also, as a direct result of one my previous project as a project manager, PCT created a senior-board that enhanced senior participation. Also, I organized the creation of a case chain to help members with case interviews during recruiting season.</p></div></div>

I guide students through a 14-week course on understanding their personal professional, corporate, and societal responsibility that all accumulates in a capstone project at the end of the course. It is my responsibility to make sure that my students develop a strong grasp of professional responsibility at the start of their careers. As a teacher and mentor, I am always discovering new ways to engage students to make business ethics and corporate responsibility applicable to their everyday decision-making process.</p>
                              <p>I strongly believe that a strong sense of professional responsibility is what makes the U of I College of Business community so great and do my best to continue spreading those values.</p>
